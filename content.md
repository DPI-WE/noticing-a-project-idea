## Introduction
Ideas are the foundation for innovative software development. Innovation often comes from observing the world around you, identifying problems, and finding potential solutions. In this lesson, we'll explore how to generate ideas organically to solve real problems for real people — and why you may be uniquely suited to do so.

> The verb you want to use regarding startup ideas is not "think up," but "notice." We call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders' own experiences "organic" startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.

## Focus on the Future

## Contextualizing Your Ideas
![bg contain](assets/grand-canyon-horseshoe.jpg)

Just as the Grand Canyon was formed over millions of years through gradual and often accidental forces of nature, our world is shaped by time, momentum, and experiences. These forces create deep channels of thought and perception, reinforcing our understanding of reality.

Many innovations arise from looking at the world differently. By stepping back and observing how systems evolve, you can spot opportunities for innovation that others might miss. To notice new ideas, we must seek higher viewpoints, understanding that our surroundings and ideas are shaped by cumulative experiences.

## Old Is New Again
Many innovative ideas are simply new takes on old concepts that arise from a fresh perspective.

### Examples
- **Airbnb**: A modern take on ancient hospitality traditions, where travelers stayed in private homes.
- **Uber**: Evolved from the concept of paid rides that dates back to horse-drawn carriages.
- **Amazon**: A digital version of mail-order catalogs and physical retail stores.
- **Craigslist**: A modern platform for classified ads, stemming from traditional newspaper listings.
- **Spotify**: A new approach to music distribution, evolving from live performances and physical media.

## Am I an Innovator?
What is the most important trait for building a new idea?
- **IQ?**
- **Knowledge?**
- **Skills?**
- **Something else?**

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) made vast contributions to art, science, engineering, and more. Known for masterpieces like the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," Da Vinci's groundbreaking designs were far ahead of his time.

Da Vinci's intelligence was essential, but raw brainpower alone isn't enough. Beyond intelligence, he possessed the knowledge and technical skills necessary for his art and inventions. Today, these skills might include coding, engineering, or design. Knowing *how* to do something doesn't guarantee insight into what *should* be done. Having a unique point of view is what turns ideas into reality.

## Point of View as a Superpower
A unique point of view allows you to build something that others might not see. It’s the combination of your life experiences, skills, and insights that enables you to notice what others overlook.

### Key Strategies
- **Look for New Combinations**: Innovation often comes from merging existing ideas in novel ways.
- **Recognize Patterns**: Understanding how different systems work and evolve can help you predict future needs.
- **Stay Curious**: Asking questions about the world around you drives exploration and can lead to valuable insights.
- **Help Yourself and Others**: Consider ways to use technology to automate tedious tasks in your life.

<!-- TODO: strong pov

- **Elon Musk**: Views technology as the key to solving humanity's greatest challenges, like space colonization and sustainable energy.
- **Steve Jobs**: Believed technology should be intuitive and beautifully designed, revolutionizing the consumer tech world.
- **Judy Faulkner**: Focused on healthcare technology, improving patient care through innovative health records management.

## Evaluating Your Ideas
When considering an idea, ask yourself the following: **Am I the Right Person to Solve This?**

Reflect on your previous experiences. Do you have unique insight or expertise in this area? You may be uniquely suited to identify, understand, and solve a problem better than anyone else.

<!-- TODO: previous projects that mapped to a trainee experience -->
#### Trainee Examples
Past trainees have leveraged their life experiences to create innovative solutions:

- **Jose**: Noticed customers at Chase Bank were unaware of credit card benefits, leading to [CreditSmart](https://www.loom.com/share/9ed1e5dcbe444bea8707ee711b89cb10?t=163&sid=3e61f441-a32d-42bd-a4f4-8fff7fb31f4e).
- **Fidel**: As a piano teacher, he recognized the need for better communication with students and parents, inspiring [LessonLinx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olk2nNJjJrE).
- **Natalie**: In Quality Assurance, she faced challenges documenting quality checks, leading to [QualiTrackr](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11vamruKx7hbhW9HG6cjFht3TnMhDZ9kL/view).
- **Adolfo**: Observed pain points in his family's dry cleaning business, resulting in [Valenti Cleaners POS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14o2SCTNXT1xVQYdEoc8PJMBIIT9oCd9F/view).

### How Big Is the Market?
Is this a problem affecting many people? Either a lot of people face this problem, or a few are willing to pay a lot to solve it.

### How Acute Is the Problem?
Is this problem genuinely painful or annoying? How often do people encounter it? (The more frequently, the better.)

### Do You Have Competition?
Competition can validate the problem's significance. It shows that others are also attempting to solve it.

### Did This Recently Become Possible or Necessary?
Has something changed in the world - new technology, laws, or emerging issues — that makes your idea timely?

### Do You Want This?
You’ll be your first customer. If the solution solves a problem for you, it's likely to help others.

### Is This an Idea You’d Want to Work on for Years?
Are you passionate about this problem? Do you have a personal connection to it? Do you enjoy working with your target users?

### Is This a Good Idea Space?
A promising idea space has many people facing the problem and willing to try your solution. Your first version will likely be imperfect, but you can learn and iterate based on user feedback. Check our [Requests for Projects page](https://rfp.dpi.dev) for potential idea spaces.

### Additional Questions to Consider
- What are your strengths?
- Is there a problem you've personally experienced that you can solve?
- Is there something you wish existed?
- Has anything changed recently that creates new opportunities?
- Are there industries that seem broken?

Don't hesitate to talk to people about their needs and experiences!

Remember, we're just building projects to build out your portfolio, learn and get better at our craft.

## Assignment: Propose Project Ideas
Start writing down ideas you notice organically and rank them based on these key questions. Focus on the **problem** or **pain point** you intend to address. Solutions are generally easier to adjust than problems.

Identify 3-5 problems or pain points you may want to address. Ensure you've considered a few before building any solutions. Use the questions from this lesson to evaluate your ideas. Submit your proposals in a spreadsheet format, answering key evaluation questions such as market size, problem frequency, and your unique insights. Don’t hesitate to reach out for a one-on-one with an instructor, TA, or fellow trainee to discuss your thoughts.

- Did you create a project idea evaluation spreadsheet?
- Yes
  - Great job!
- No
  - Please create an ideas spreadsheet using the template.
{: .choose_best #project_ideas_spreadsheet title="Project Ideas Spreadsheet URL" points="1" answer="1" }

<div class="alert alert-danger mt-2">

Return to Canvas and submit the URL of your ideas spreadsheet in the assignment "Noticing a Project Idea: Spreadsheet". I recommend booking time with an instructor or TA to get more feedback on your ideas.
