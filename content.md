<!-- INTRO -->
Ideas are the foundation for innovative software development

In this lesson, we'll explore how to "notice" rather than "think up" ideas.

> "...everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you"

<!-- Focus on the future -->
Innovation often comes from observing the world around you, identifying problems, and finding potential solutions. 
<!-- Many famous innovators, like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Wayne Gretzky, have shared their insights about focusing on the future rather than what's already been done. -->

## You exist in the context of all that came before you
<!-- The Canyon Metaphor for Ideas -->
Just as the Grand Canyon was formed over millions of years through gradual, often accidental forces of nature, our world is shaped by time, momentum, and experiences. These forces create deep channels of thought and perception, reinforcing our understanding of reality.

Many innovations arise from simply looking at the world differently. By stepping back and observing how systems evolve, you can spot opportunities for innovation that others might miss.

<!-- 
Key takeaway: To notice new ideas, we must look beyond the immediate and seek higher viewpoints, understanding that our surroundings and ideas are shaped by cumulative experiences over time. 
-->


<!-- Point of View as a Superpower -->
Having a unique point of view allows you to build something that others might not see. Itâ€™s the combination of your life experiences, skills, and insights that enable you to notice what others overlook.

<!-- 
Key Insights:
Look for New Combinations: Innovation often comes from combining existing ideas in new ways. Consider how current technologies can intersect to create something novel.
Recognize Patterns: Pay attention to how different systems work and evolve. Understanding these patterns can help you predict future needs and challenges.
Stay Curious: Ask questions about the world around you. Curiosity drives exploration and can lead to valuable insights.
 -->
Consider these examples:

- Elon Musk: Views technology as the key to solving humanity's greatest challenges, like space colonization and sustainable energy.
- Steve Jobs: Believed technology should be intuitive and beautifully designed, revolutionizing the consumer tech world.
- Judy Faulkner: Focused on healthcare technology, improving patient care through innovative health records management.

<!-- What makes a good innovator?  -->

What is the most important trait for building a new idea?

<!-- TODO: davinci example -->

IQ? - Intelligence helps, but raw brainpower alone isn't enough.

Knowledge and Skill? - Necessary, but knowing how to do something doesn't guarantee insight into what should be done.

<!-- * Knowledge of how to do something
  * Coding
  * Engineering
  * Design
  * etc. -->

Point of View? - This is what turns ideas into reality. The combination of your unique perspective, skills, and intelligence can produce the best ideas.

<!-- previous trainee examples -->

<!-- How to evaluate project ideas -->
## When considering an idea, ask yourself the following:

### Are you the right person to solve this?
- Is this a field you have an expertise or insight?
- Think about your previous experiences and work.
- You may be uniquely suited to identify, understand, and solve a problem better than anyone else.
- Do you have unique insight or expertise in this area?
- Is this a field you have an expertise or insight?
- Think about your previous experiences and work.
- You may be uniquely suited to identify, understand, and solve a problem better than anyone else.

<!-- TODO: previous projects that mapped to a trainee experience -->

### How big is the market?
- Do a lot of people have this problem?
- More is usually better
- A lot of people have the problem **OR** a few people are willing to pay a lot to solve it
<!-- pricing -->
<!-- difficuly in finding users / customers -->

### How acute is the problem?
- Is it really painful and/or annoying?
- How often do people encounter this problem?
    - daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
    - more often is better

<!-- eg uber: I need to get places multiple times a day -->
<!-- buying a house: once a lifetime maybe? -->

Is this a problem a lot of people experience, or is it so acute that a few people would pay a lot to solve it?
How frequent or painful is the problem?

The more often people encounter a problem, the better.

### Do you have competition?
- This might be a good sign!
- Competition *might* validate that this is a real problem.


Competition can be a good sign! It shows that others are also working to solve the problem, validating its significance.

### Did this recently become possible or necessary?
- Has something about the world changed recently?
- New technology, law, problem, etc.

### Do you want this?
- You'll already have a first user... you!
- Are there a lot of other people like you?
You should be your own first customer. If it solves a problem for you, it's likely to solve it for others.

### Is this an idea you'd want to work on for years?
- Are you passionate about this problem?
- Do you have a personal connection?
- Do you like your user?


### Is this a good idea space?
- A good idea space has a lot of people with this problem willing to try your solution (and pay for it)
- Your first version will probably be wrong
- You will learn a lot by building, deploying and getting feedback from users
- If you're in a good idea space (high potential for success) you can iterate towards the optimal solution
- Check out our [Requests for Projects page](https://rfp.dpi.dev) for some good idea spaces

Generally, building something you find interesting or in a field you have an expertise or insight is a good start!


### More questions to consider

- What are you good at?
- Is there a problem you've personally encountered you can build a solution for?
- Is there something you just wish existed?
- Is there something about the world that has changed recently that has created an opportunity?
- Go out and talk to people!
- Is there a big industry that seems broken?


<!-- quiz question -->

<!-- Is This the Right Idea for You? -->
<!-- Are you the right person to solve this? -->
To help evaluate whether an idea is worth pursuing, consider:

Did something recently change in the world that makes this idea possible or necessary?
Do you want to work on this idea for years? Building a successful project can take time, and passion is essential to sustain motivation.
Is the idea space you're entering large enough to allow iteration and growth?

<!-- if you're not sure that's ok! we're just building projects to learn and get better at our craft.   -->

<!-- Remember, we're just building fun learning projects to build your portfolio. I don't expect you to change the world,... yet. ðŸ˜… -->

<!-- Assignment: Propose Project Ideas -->
I recommend you start writing down ideas you notice organically and rank them on these key questions.
Focus on the **problem** / **pain point** you plan to address
Solutions are easier to change than problems

- Identify 3-5 problems or pain points you may want to address.
- We want to make sure you have at lest considered a few problems before building any solutions.
- Use the questions from this lesson to evaluate your ideas.
- Submit your proposals in a spreadsheet format, answering key evaluation questions such as market size, problem frequency, your unique insight into the problem, etc.
- Don't hesitate to reach out for a 1on1 with an instructor, TA, or fellow trainee and talk through what you are thinking.
